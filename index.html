				<h2>Welcome</h2>

				<p>Welcome to my web page about rasterized 3D graphics. Here I will describe some of the mathematics and concepts applied in computer graphics.</p>

				<h2>Motivation</h2>

				<p>I started this page in the hope that someone who tries to understand those things will find it useful. I love this topic, since I find it facinating. It is impressive how all of those mathematical pieces come together. Not to mention the amazing visual effects.</p>

				<h2>Getting started</h2>

				<p>Sit back, relax, get some snacks and get ready to enter the rabbit hole.</p>
