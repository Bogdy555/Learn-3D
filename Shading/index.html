				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>There were a few techniques over the years to shade 3D models. I would like to show them all and present some differences.</p>

			</section>

			<section>

				<h2>1. Phong shading</h2>

				<p>This is one of the first ones that was quite widly spread and used. It is a crude aproximation, but it gave good enought results.</p>

					<img id = "Phong" src = "https://learnopengl.com/img/lighting/basic_lighting_phong.png" alt = "Phong shading image.">
				</div>

			</section>

			<section>

				<h2>2. Blinn-Phong shading</h2>

				<p>The Phong aproach was quite flawed when it came to specular lighting on small angles, so it was later improved to <a href = "https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Advanced-Lighting">Blinn-Phong</a></p>

				<div class = "CenteringDivs">
					<img id = "Blinn-Phong" src = "https://learnopengl.com/img/advanced-lighting/advanced_lighting_comparrison.png" alt = "Blinn-Phong shading image.">
				</div>

				<h2>3. PBR with IBL shading</h2>

				<p><a href = "https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Theory">PBR</a> is the best that we got so far. As the name suggests, it is physically based. It respects the laws of conservation, the microfacet model and the Fresnel effect.</p>
